university_projects
===================
This repository contains the most of my programming assignments, related to my university; some of them were implemented with other colleagues, because of the team spirit that the assignment tried to create. Let's have a quick look at the folders' structure.

<b>OOP_II</b> This folder is about a personal programming assignment is C++, which had to visualize an infirmary's software application, that handled doctors' appointments. Overall: 80%.

<b>computer_architecture</b> : This project was about implementing the famous game "Simon Says" in assembly x86. It was a team project, where both two of us contributed to the design and the implementation. It got 100%.

<b>computer_graphics</b>

<b>software_engineering</b> : The purpose of this project was to understand the fundamentals of UML. I was the leader in a team of 3, in this project; we successfully accomplished to present a fully working desktop application, written in JAVA, handled with MySQL and presented with Java Swing. The project involved 3 separate sections: 1) Requirements Engineering, 2) Design Engineering , 3) Coding. I was responsible for the supervision of the other 2 members of my team. I also had my separate parts in sections 1) and 2) and I did wrote all the code for this project. During this assignment, I saw how important is UML for large-scale projects; when it was time to code, everything came out so simply, by just combining the Use Case, Sequence, Activity and Class Diagrams and I didn't notice how easy the code was being deployed, since I measured about 4k lines of code; this was my very first large-scale project, so I was very excited about it. It got 10/10 and awarded as the best student project for the subject of <b>Software Engineering</b>. I will soon upload the related UML diagrams, too. Last, but not least, I didn't emphasize in the design, as the assignment's main scope was to understand the fundamentals of UML. You can find a video-demo (in Greek; excuse me, but I didn't know that I was going to upload it to Github!), explaining our application's functionality, in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwF392wdixcxRUtpNk80OXpzVjA/edit?usp=sharing">link</a>.
